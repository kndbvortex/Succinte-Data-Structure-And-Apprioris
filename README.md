# Succinte-Data-Structure-And-Apprioris
This is the source code in which we have tried to implement succint data structure and apriori algorithm in oberon and Pascal. 
The files named Arc, Arrete, Graphe, ListeInt, QueuInt, Structure, and Tree with .Mod or .pas extension (depending of oberon and pascal langage) are used for succintes dataStructure. 
APRIORI, APRIORIiID, Extraction, ListeChaine and SETM files with .Mod or .pas extension are used for appriori algorithm
